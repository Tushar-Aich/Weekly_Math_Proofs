## About the Project

**Rigorous Saturdays** is a weekly initiative dedicated to reconstructing the foundations of mathematics.

In undergraduate studies, theorems are often introduced as computational tools or intuitive rules. While efficient, this approach often bypasses the deep analytical machinery that makes these theorems true.

This repository serves as the technical companion to my LinkedIn series, where I break down one major theorem every weekend—moving beyond "how to calculate" to "why it works."

## The Philosophy

The goal of this collection is not just to rewrite textbook proofs, but to:
1.  **Bridge the Gap:** Connect geometric intuition (like "area under a curve") with analytic rigor (epsilon-delta arguments).
2.  **Visualize the Logic:** Use precise LaTeX formatting and diagrams to make dense logical arguments readable and accessible.
3.  **Open Source Knowledge:** Provide the full `.tex` source code for students and researchers to study, adapt, and improve.
